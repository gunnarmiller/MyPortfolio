# PortfolioInterim
## About
Greetings,
Welcome to my interim programming portfolio. I'm still in the process of adding, cleaning up and organizing code files, so expect the contents of this portfolio to change from one day to the next. I ultimately intend to replace this with a proper, polished portfolio using GitHub Pages: but I expect most readers will care about the code more than the packaging, so I'm focusing on that first.

## Attribution: 
Everything here is chosen because it showcases my work. That said, things like projects often involve code written by multiple people, and class assignment sometimes come with pre-written code. If a significant portion of a file is not my work, I will clearly mark which portion and attempt to include an appropriate attribution. If a file is unmarked, you can safely assume it was written almost entirely by me: the only thing I might not mark is the basic skeleton or connective-tissue pieces sometimes provided for class assignments.

## Contents
### 1. Short Programs
This section is for short, stand-alone programs. Usually these were written as a homework assignment for a class I was taking. Everything here at present is Python code from the class CMPT 732: Big Data Lab that I took in the Fall of 2023 at Simon Fraser. As I add more items, I'll separate this out into subsections.

### 2. Space Travel Simulator Project
**Concept** The basic idea of this project is to simulate travel time and fuel-use for a spacecraft making one-way interstellar voyages. All the numbers and calculations provided are as realistic as I was able to make them in a three-week timespan, doing research about largely speculative technology. The assumptions underlying the spacecraft masses and exhaust velocity are based on Nuclear Pulse Propulsion, one of the current most-practical proposals for interstellar travel. That being said, the core of the math is the same Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation that governs all sub-relativistic rocketry, so the program would work just as well to simulate chemical rockets: all you'd need to do is change the exhaust velocity to a number appropriate for chemcial propellants. I orginally explore the possibility of either a relativistic rocket, or a simulator for trips between bodies within our solar system, both both of those would have required more time brushing up on the relevant math than I thought I could cram into three weeks.

**Origin** This project was written for a class I was taking at University of the Fraser Valley. The class was an introduction to C++ programming, a topic I was already quite familiar with, though several years out of practice. I conceded to taking the class after an extended and frustrating dialog with the registrar's office: they weren't willing to count any of my previous work (done at U.S. universities) for course prerequisites without a long evaluation process, a hefty fee, and a large pile of documentation that (as far as I was able to discover) mostly didn't exist for the classes in question. After three weeks of trying to deal with them, I decided a semester's worth of programming homework and quizzes couldn't possibly be *more* of a headache, and anyway it would be an excuse to know the rust off. For that reason, this project and the eReader one are both significantly more ambitious than the class requirements dictated: I figured if I was going to spent time reviewing my C++, I'd learn more if I pushed my limits as much as possible. For this project the requirements were to write a program simulating the fuel-efficiency of a vehicle under various conditions. The default vehicle suggestions were either a car or a plane, with conditions like traffic, wind, travel distance and so forth. All of that sounded boring, hence spacecraft. I ended up biting off slightly more than I could chew with this idea, but only slightly: the last few days before the deadline were a crunch, and I could have used more time for documentation, testing and organizing the code, but I got all the important bits done. The credit from the class itself was ultimately rendered useless when I switched to my current program at SFU, but the practice and the projects were both nice things to take away from it.

### 3. Vancouver Housing Analysis/ML Model
**Concept** The code currently in the repo is drawn from a larger project that I worked on with a group of fellow students and SFU during the Spring Semester of 2024. The wider project is described below, but the piece showcased here is a machine learning model whose main goal was to predict future housing price trends in Vancouver (or any city that equivalent data could be drawn from). The secondary goal was to be able to fill in "gaps" in property price data: if you know a bunch of other things about a property but not the price, can the model be trained to predict the price? Most of the actual work on this project was just processing the data into a form that could be used for the ML model: the model itself is off-the-shelf and easy to use. All of the code

**Origin** The larger project this was part of was an analysis of housing affordability trends in the greater Vancouver area. It drew data from a wide variety of municipal sources, which it used to make an interactive map showing housing and property prices for the various communities in the area. The data to build the map was drawn from a variety of municipal websites, using the coding expertise and online detetctive-work of various other group members. The map was set to display data for any year that we'd been able to gather it for. The idea behind the machine learning model is that we also wanted the map to be able to display predicted data for future years. That could have been done easily enough through linear regression over the recent prices or something similar, but a machine learning model would let predictions factor in things like planned improvements, such as future skytrain lines or proposed construction projects: things that wouldn't already be factored into the price data for existing years.
