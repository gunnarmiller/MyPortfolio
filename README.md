# PortfolioInterim
## About
Greetings,
Welcome to my interim programming portfolio. I'm still in the process of adding, cleaning up and organizing code files, so expect the contents of this portfolio to change from one day to the next. I ultimately intend to replace this with a proper, polished portfolio using GitHub Pages: but I expect most readers will care about the code more than the packaging, so I'm focusing on that first.

Attribution Note: Everything here is chosen because it showcases my work. That said, things like projects often involve code written by multiple people, and class assignment sometimes come with pre-written code. If a significant portion of a file is not my work, I will clearly mark which portion and attempt to include an appropriate attribution. If a file is unmarked, you can safely assume it was written almost entirely by me: the only thing I might not mark is the basic skeleton or connective-tissue pieces sometimes provided for class assignments.

## Contents
### 1. Short Programs
This section is for short, stand-alone programs. Usually these were written as a homework assignment for a class I was taking.
