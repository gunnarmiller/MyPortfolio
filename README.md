# PortfolioInterim
Greetings,
Welcome to my interim programming portfolio. I'm still in the process of adding, cleaning up and organizing code files, so expect the contents of this portfolio to change from one day to the next. I ultimately intend to replace this with a proper, polished portfolio using GitHub Pages: but I expect most readers will care about the code more than the packaging, so I'm focusing on that first.
